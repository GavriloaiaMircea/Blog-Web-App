# Blog Web App
 Blog Web App is a simple full-stack application built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. This version uses in-memory storage, so posts do not persist between sessions. The application is styled for a modern look and responsive design.
